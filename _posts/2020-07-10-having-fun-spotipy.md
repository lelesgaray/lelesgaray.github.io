This post explores some of the Spotipy possibilities and analyses.

## Libraries import and authentification

Let's start by importing the libraries that we are going to use
```python
# write a simple Python function
# libraries import
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from dateutil.parser import parse as parse_date

# spotify libraries
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials
from spotipy import util
```
Next we need to authentificate our user and credentials. To do this, we first create an application in the [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and gather the credentials. Then it's easy to initialize and authorize the client:

```python
token = util.prompt_for_user_token(username = user,
                                   scope = 'user-top-read',
                                   client_id= client_id,
                                   client_secret=client_secret,
                                   redirect_uri= 'http://localhost/')

spotify = spotipy.Spotify(auth=token)
```
> In case you are struggling to get the `user`, `client_id` and `client_secret`, I recommend this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxSKrVXeKcI) and this [tutorial](https://support.appreciationengine.com/article/oaNki9g06n-creating-a-spotify-application) to help you configure your app.



You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
# write a simple Python function
def function(number):
  result = number +1
  return result

```
